RecyclerViewUtils Library
=============

This library contains a few core classes that are often used alongside a RecyclerView, and are intended to remove some of the tidious boilerplate code from being written many times.

Usage
-----

To have access to the library, add the dependency to your build.gradle:

```java
	compile 'com.adammcneilly:recyclerviewutils:1.0.0'
```

CoreViewHolder
--------------

At the heart of these classes is [CoreViewHolder](https://github.com/AdamMc331/RecyclerViewUtils/blob/master/lib/src/main/java/com/adammcneilly/recyclerviewutils/CoreViewHolder.java) which is a RecyclerView.ViewHolder class used to display an object of a specific type. It has one abstract method for binding an object of that type.

CoreRecyclerViewAdapter
-----------------------

Using the CoreViewHolder class from above, the [CoreRecyclerViewAdapter](https://github.com/AdamMc331/RecyclerViewUtils/blob/master/lib/src/main/java/com/adammcneilly/recyclerviewutils/CoreRecyclerViewAdapter.java) is an abstract base class for using an adapter of objects with a given type. By using a generic type, we were able to override many boilerplate methods such as:

 * add
 * remove
 * swapItems
 * onBindViewHolder

CoreDividerItemDecoration
-------------------------

The [CoreDividerItemDecoration](https://github.com/AdamMc331/RecyclerViewUtils/blob/master/lib/src/main/java/com/adammcneilly/recyclerviewutils/CoreDividerItemDecoration.java) class is used to display a simple line divider between list items in your RecyclerView.
